AfricTivistes CitizenLab Benin is a dedicated citizens' network committed to supporting, accompanying, and equipping civil society players in Benin through comprehensive training and the development of innovative tools.

The blog stands as a testament to my commitment to innovation, seamlessly blending the power of Astro.js, a Static Site Generator (SSG), with the efficiency of WordPress as a headless CMS. This powerful combination ensures a rapid, SEO-focused, and highly customizable blogging experience.
